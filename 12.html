  Don't know what do to but I have a huge plan. I will get PR and go back to Korea and chill as hell with my friends and fam.
  <br>I am going to be an expert in this area. I am doing baby step of Java language which is HTML. However, this basic is important and all of computer language.
  <br>Ultimately I will use this skill to save the earth. I am very passionate about environment. I have willing to save ocean lives.
  <br>I will get rescue diver from <u><a href="여기다가 패디 링크달기">PADI</a></u> and try my best to conserve the oceans.
