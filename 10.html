  I was born in Korea and lived for 25 years. I was very introvert person but i was too busy to pretent i was not.
  <br>I started playing sports when i was 11. Martial Arts was big part of my life back then. It made me activie person.
  <br>I have got more friends and we also became the truble makers in school. At that time I thought I was a king of the world haha. Very rude kid.
  <br>High school life was the best time of my life. Even though I was not good at studying I was deligent. Had a great relationship with friends and teachers.
  <br>University life was kind of turning point of my life. I found myself honestly and deeply. Started studying for the first time.
  <br>Thought I have achieved so many things but I am still a kid.
